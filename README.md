to track events and provide login intelligence.

## Getting this in your own app:

  1. Install the [`thisdata-ruby` gem](https://github.com/thisdata/thisdata-ruby), and follow its installation instructions
    - see [`config/this_data.rb`](https://github.com/thisdata/thisdata-devise-example/blob/master/config/initializers/this_data.rb) for an example configuration file
  1. Copy [`lib/this_data/warden_hooks.rb`](https://github.com/thisdata/thisdata-devise-example/blob/master/lib/this_data/warden_hooks.rb) in to your own project
  1. Add `require 'this_data/warden_hooks'` to [`config/initializers/devise.rb`](https://github.com/thisdata/thisdata-devise-example/blob/2b320ee127eb4f620a482f91228121846280def3/config/initializers/devise.rb#L26)

### If you want to track failed log-ins

If you haven't already extended `Devise::SessionsController`:

  1. Copy [`app/controllers/my_sessions_controller.rb`](https://github.com/thisdata/thisdata-devise-example/blob/master/app/controllers/my_sessions_controller.rb)
  1. In [`routes.rb`](https://github.com/thisdata/thisdata-devise-example/blob/master/config/routes.rb), change your `devise_for` line to look like
```
devise_for :users, controllers: { :sessions => "my_sessions" }
```

You can change the name of the controller if you wish.

If you have already extended `Devise::SessionsController`, copy the protected
`auth_options` method over into your controller.

### What do you get?!

This will enable tracking of

  - `log-in` - successful login events
  - `log-in-denied` - when someone fails to log in
    - if the email/username is correct, the corresponding User details are tracked
  - `log-out` - when the user logs out
  - `page-view` - each page viewed in your app, containing user information
   when they're logged in

### Want more?

If you've extended your Devise controllers, you should make sure to include
tracking for

  - `password-reset-request` - someone asked to reset their password
  - `password-reset` - a User reset their password
  - `password-reset-request`
  - `email-update`
  - `password-update`

If you support Two Factor Authentication:

  - `authentication-challenge`
  - `authentication-challenge-pass`
  - `authentication-challenge-fail`
  - `two-factor-disable`
  
And any other event you like! Read more: ["What events should I track?"](help.thisdata.com/docs/what-events-should-i-track)
